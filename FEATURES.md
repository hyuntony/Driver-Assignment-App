- Validations when editing revenue and cost for the order to check that it is a number and that they exist
- The minimum requirement states that editing revnue/cost is only required for orders that do not have
  a driver assigned, but the bonus feature asks to allow editing revenue/cost when order is assigned to
  a driver. I allowed editing for all the orders.
